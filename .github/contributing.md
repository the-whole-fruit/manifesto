## Things you could do

- improve the manifesto, guidelines, everything - we don't claim to know it all;
- improve our templates - they can get better with the experience of more people;
- review and give your opinion on [existing issues](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/issues);

- [adopt the manifesto](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto#how-to-adopt);

### Rules for writing effectively

This project stands by [The Whole Fruit Manifesto](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto). We believe that “_writing good code_” is not only about “_writing good code_”. It’s also about the words around it. That’s why, to make sure your contribution is well received, we ask you to [read and apply the ONE=MOR framework and guidelines](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto) when writing comment blocks, PR titles, PR descriptions, and in general, when writing to our community.


Thank you for contributing!
