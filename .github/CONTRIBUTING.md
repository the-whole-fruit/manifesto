# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited:
- code contributions are accepted via Pull Requests to the [my-vendor/my-package]() repo;
- financial contributions are usually in the form of [donations](), [license purchases](), [projects]() or [jobs](); 
- documentation contributions are accepted via Pull Requests to the [my-vendor/my-package]() repo;
- other contributions are most likely welcome in the way you see fit;

## Things you could do

If you want to contribute but do not know where to start, this list provides some starting points.
- improve [our documentation]();
- provide more examples;
- review and test [existing PRs]();
- review [bug reports]();
- offer to code [approved feature requests]();
- answer [support requests]();

## How to do those things

### Pull Requests
- **Add tests!** - Your patch will be accepted MUCH faster if it has tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

### Issues
- **Answer all items in the issue template** - It helps us resolve problems without a lot of back-and-forth.
- **No support requests** - The maintainers and people who follow this project are all busy people. Do not expect them to help you code something that will only work inside your project, or debug an issue that is most likely your own doing. 

### Rules for writing effectively (ONE = MOR framework)

This project stands by [The Whole Fruit Manifesto](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto). We believe that “writing good code” is not only about “writing good code”. It’s also about the words around it. That’s why, to make sure your contribution is well received, please apply the following rules when writing comment blocks, PR titles, PR descriptions, and in general, when writing to our community.

The **ONE = MOR framework** was created to help software developers communicate better in writing. Below you'll find us going through the framework, explaining how we see it applied to your contributions. We believe that even if you take the time to read this just once, it will greatly help you write better contributions.

#### (1) ORGANIZE information to fit your goals and readers (the result is your _blueprint_)
- **Mob** - know your readers
    - _What drives the Developer reading your PR?_ The reader of your PR is a software developer, just like you. They have probably put in hundreds or thousands of hours of their life into this project, that makes no money, or very little money. Most likely they are busy, have full-time jobs, spouses, children, pets. But, _just like you_, they have _a passion for building stuff_, and they love that _their work actually helps people_. That's why they started this. That's why they keep doing it.
- **Mission** - determine your objectives
    - To get your PR approved.
    - To make it as fast as possible for your fix/feature merged.
    - To lend a helping hand to someone who’s already helped you, by creating and maintaining this project.
- **Message** - find what will make your readers act for your mission
    - In order for the maintainers to merge your PR, they’ll need to:
        - Easily understand what problem you’re fixing.
        - Agree that the problem is worth fixing.
        - Easily merge your work into theirs.
    - Most of the time, the that means your message should be
        - Code that is easy to read and easy to understand.
        - Code that works and is well-tested.
        - Code that is well commented.
        - PR title that defines the problem being fixed.
        - PR description that explaines how the problem is being fixed.
- **Medium** - select the best communication channel to use
    - For small contributions, go ahead and create a PR.
    - For bigger contributions, it’s better to create an Issue first, to make sure the problem you discovered is worth working on; don’t start working, before you know your work will be merged.
- **Mood** - think about the tone that will make your message more convincing
    - Try to be informal, but not impolite. You’re talking to a colleague.
    - Jokes are welcome and appreciated. Especially good ones.
    - One or two emojis or GIFs can easily lighten the mood.
- **Mould** - Decide the structure that will carry your message home
    - The Issue or PR you’re opening should already include some text and headlines, to make sure your message is well structured. Try to answer all existing headlines. If needed, add new headlines, but don’t delete the existing ones, they’re there for a reason.
    - If there’s no Issue template, here’s [a good structure for a Bug Report](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/examples/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
    - If there’s no PR template, here’s [a good structure for a PR description](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/examples/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pull_request.md)

#### (2) NOTE everything down following the blueprint (the result is your _unpolished text_)
- Only clear Subjects
- Only clear Actions
- Only the right Style
- Only the right Length

#### (3) EDIT it to make sure it does what it needs to do (the result is your _final text_)
- Read once for sense and structure
- Read once to make sure it sounds good
- Read once for grammar


Happy coding!
