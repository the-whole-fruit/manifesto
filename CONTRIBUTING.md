### Rules for writing effectively

This project stands by [The Whole Fruit Manifesto](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto). We believe that “_writing good code_” is not only about “_writing good code_”. It’s also about the words around it. That’s why, to make sure your contribution is well received, we ask you to [read and apply the ONE=MOR framework and guidelines](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto) when writing comment blocks, PR titles, PR descriptions, and in general, when writing to our community.


Thank you for contributing!
