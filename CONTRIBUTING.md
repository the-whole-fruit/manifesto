# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited. We try to help developers improve the way _they_ write, and part of that is being open to improve the way _we_ write. We're open to feedback, and eager to improve the way we communicate inside software projects, including this one. Please submit an issue, submit a PR or use one of the methods outlined below to join our cause and help it spread.



## Add this section to your CONTRIBUTING.md

One small block of text to add to your contributing.md file, one giant leap in software quality for your project.

As you know, this file is used by Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab to show your users a few guidelines before they submit a PR. We think it's a perfect place to introduce your contributors to the way you'd like your community to write. If you adhere to The Whole Fruit Manifesto, please consider adding the following principles to help your contributors produce better code. 


```markdown
## Rules for writing effectively (ONE = M6O4R3 framework)

// TODO
```

## Include a shield in your project

Shields (aka badges) usually let people know about your project status, standards and permissions. We think it's a perfect place to also communicate that your project intends to abide by The Whole Fruit Manifesto. That people should read its text and follow its guidelines. 

You can add the shield below at the top of your README.md using one of the code options under it. 

[![We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. It’s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words.](https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen)](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto)

```js
[![We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. It’s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words.](https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen)](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto)

// or

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen" title="We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. It’s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words.">](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto)
```

Alternatively, you can use [shields.io](https://shields.io) to make a shield that's a better fit for your project. Make sure you point it to `https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto`

## Sign the manifesto

If you're the owner of an open-source project or large company, you can add your name to our SIGNATORIES.md file. This will:
- help you _publicly_ commit to follow The Whole Fruit Manifesto and its guidelines in your software projects;
- help other people understand the importance of our cause - that _better writing makes for better software_;
