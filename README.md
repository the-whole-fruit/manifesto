# The Whole Fruit Manifesto 

We believe that “writing good code” is not only about “writing good code”. Sure, the code is the kernel. But around it, or about it, the software developer has to write a lot of words. 

- Technical Documentation
- Code Comments
- Commits, Pull Requests
- Tasks
- Emails

We believe that good code can be made bad by improper use of words around it. Therefore, a software developer who strives to deliver good code needs to also communicate efficiently in writing. 

Such is the whole fruit of a developer’s labor, kernel and all.

## Guidelines for Writing Effectively

The **ONE = MOR framework** was created to help software developers communicate better in writing. So feel free to link to this section in your Contributing.md. 

We believe that reading this section just once will result in better contributions and better communication for your team of developers.

### (1) ORGANIZE information to fit your goals and readers (the result is your _blueprint_)
- **Mob** - know your readers
    - The readers of your PR are software developers, just like you. What compels them to read your PR? If you’re contributing to an open source project, they’ve probably put in hundreds or thousands of hours of their life into a project that makes no money, or very little money. Most likely they are busy, have full-time jobs, spouses, children, pets. But, just like you, they have a passion for building stuff, and they love that their work actually helps people. If you're contributing to your company’s project, then the developer who reviews the PR has to do it because it’s her job. Either way, you want to make their life as easy as possible and the task as pleasant as possible. Don’t treat them like they don’t have a choice but to review your code. Because, _just like you_, they have _a passion for building stuff_, and they love that _their work actually helps people_. That's why they started this. That's why they keep doing it.
- **Mission** - determine your objectives
    - To get your PR approved. From the first try, if possible.
    - To lend a helping hand to someone who’s already helped you, by creating and maintaining this project.
- **Message** - find what will make your readers act for your mission
    - In order for the maintainers to merge your PR, they’ll need to:
        - Easily understand what problem you’re fixing.
        - Agree that the problem is worth fixing.
        - Easily merge your work into the existing code base.
    - Most of the time, the message that should come across is that:
        - Your code contributes something important.
        - Your code is easy to read and well-commented.
        - Your code works and is well-tested.
        - PR title that defines the problem being fixed.
        - PR description that explaines how the problem is being fixed.
- **Medium** - select the best communication channel to use
    - For small contributions, go ahead and create a PR.
    - For bigger contributions, it’s better to create an Issue first, to make sure the problem you discovered is worth working on; don’t start working, before you know your work will be merged.
- **Mood** - think about the tone that will make your message more convincing
    - Try to be informal, but not impolite. You’re talking to a colleague.
    - Jokes are welcome and appreciated. Especially good ones.
    - But most importantly, be direct. You are improving something specific.
    - Bonus tip: One or two emojis or GIFs can easily lighten the mood.
- **Mould** - Decide the structure that will carry your message home
    - The Issue or PR you’re opening should already include some text and headlines, to make sure your message is well structured. Try to answer all existing headlines. If needed, add new headlines, but don’t delete the existing ones, they’re there for a reason.
    - If there’s no Issue template, here’s [a good structure for a Bug Report](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
    - If there’s no PR template, here’s [a good structure for a PR description](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pull_request.md).

### (2) NOTE everything down following the blueprint (the result is your _unpolished text_)
- Only clear Subjects
- Only clear Actions
- Only the right Style
- Only the right Length

### (3) EDIT it to make sure it does what it needs to do (the result is your _final text_)
- Read once for sense and structure
- Read once to make sure it sounds good
- Read once for grammar

## How to Adopt

#### Add a section to your CONTRIBUTING.md

One small block of text to add to your contributing.md file, one giant leap in software quality for your project.

As you know, this file is used by Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab to show your users a few guidelines before they submit a PR. We think it's a perfect place to introduce your contributors to the way you'd like your community to write. If you adhere to The Whole Fruit Manifesto, please consider copy-pasting or linking its guidelines to help your contributors produce better code. Here's [an example `CONTRIBUTING.md` file](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), that we think is a good start.


#### Include a shield in your project

Shields (aka badges) usually let people know about your project status, standards and permissions. We think it's a perfect place to also communicate that your project intends to abide by The Whole Fruit Manifesto. That people should read its text and follow its guidelines. 

You can add the shield below at the top of your README.md using one of the code options under it. 

[![We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. It’s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words.](https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen)](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto)

```js
[![We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. It’s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words.](https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen)](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto)

// or

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen" title="We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. It’s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words.">](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto)
```

Alternatively, you can use [shields.io](https://shields.io) to make a shield that's a better fit for your project. Make sure you point it to `https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto`

#### Sign the manifesto

If you're the owner of an open-source project or organisation, you can add your name to our SIGNATORIES.md file. This will:
- help you _publicly_ commit to follow The Whole Fruit Manifesto and its guidelines in your software projects;
- help other people understand the importance of our cause - that _better writing makes for better software_;

## About

This project is the result of many years of added frustration. Time and time again we've seen _great_ projects & developers, who limit their success because of their poor communication. So much so, that it's something we are compelled to do - promote the importance of good writing in web development.
