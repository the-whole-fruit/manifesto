# The Whole Fruit Manifesto

We believe that “writing good code” is not only about “writing good code”. Sure, the code is the kernel. But around it, or about it, the software developer has to write a lot of words.

- Technical Documentation
- Code Comments
- Commits, Pull Requests
- Tasks
- Emails

We believe that good code can be made bad by improper use of words around it. Therefore, a software developer who strives to deliver good code needs to also communicate efficiently in writing. 

Such is the whole fruit of a developer’s labor, kernel and all.
