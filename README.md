# The Whole Fruit Manifesto

We believe that “writing good code” is not only about “writing good code”. Sure, the code is the kernel. But around it, or about it, the software developer has to write a lot of words. 

- Technical Documentation
- Code Comments
- Commits, Pull Requests
- Tasks
- Emails

We believe that good code can be made bad by improper use of words around it. Therefore, a software developer who strives to deliver good code needs to also communicate efficiently in writing. 

Such is the whole fruit of a developer’s labor, kernel and all.

One small link to add to your contributing.md file, 
one giant leap in software quality for your project. 

If you adhere to The Whole Fruit Manifesto, please consider adding a link to the following principles to help your contributors produce better code. This file gets improved all the time with examples and best practices.


# Rules for writing effectively (ONE = MOR framework)

The **ONE = MOR framework** was created to help software developers communicate better in writing. Below you'll find us going through the framework, explaining how we see it applied to software contributions. We believe that even if you take the time to read this just once, it will greatly help you write better contributions.

#### (1) ORGANIZE information to fit your goals and readers (the result is your _blueprint_)
- **Mob** - know your readers
    - _What drives the Developer reading your PR?_ The reader of your PR is a software developer, just like you. They have probably put in hundreds or thousands of hours of their life into this project, that makes no money, or very little money. Most likely they are busy, have full-time jobs, spouses, children, pets. But, _just like you_, they have _a passion for building stuff_, and they love that _their work actually helps people_. That's why they started this. That's why they keep doing it.
- **Mission** - determine your objectives
    - To get your PR approved.
    - To make it as fast as possible for your fix/feature merged.
    - To lend a helping hand to someone who’s already helped you, by creating and maintaining this project.
- **Message** - find what will make your readers act for your mission
    - In order for the maintainers to merge your PR, they’ll need to:
        - Easily understand what problem you’re fixing.
        - Agree that the problem is worth fixing.
        - Easily merge your work into theirs.
    - Most of the time, the that means your message should be
        - Code that is easy to read and easy to understand.
        - Code that works and is well-tested.
        - Code that is well commented.
        - PR title that defines the problem being fixed.
        - PR description that explaines how the problem is being fixed.
- **Medium** - select the best communication channel to use
    - For small contributions, go ahead and create a PR.
    - For bigger contributions, it’s better to create an Issue first, to make sure the problem you discovered is worth working on; don’t start working, before you know your work will be merged.
- **Mood** - think about the tone that will make your message more convincing
    - Try to be informal, but not impolite. You’re talking to a colleague.
    - Jokes are welcome and appreciated. Especially good ones.
    - One or two emojis or GIFs can easily lighten the mood.
- **Mould** - Decide the structure that will carry your message home
    - The Issue or PR you’re opening should already include some text and headlines, to make sure your message is well structured. Try to answer all existing headlines. If needed, add new headlines, but don’t delete the existing ones, they’re there for a reason.
    - If there’s no Issue template, here’s [a good structure for a Bug Report](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/examples/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
    - If there’s no PR template, here’s [a good structure for a PR description](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/examples/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pull_request.md)

#### (2) NOTE everything down following the blueprint (the result is your _unpolished text_)
- Only clear Subjects
- Only clear Actions
- Only the right Style
- Only the right Length

#### (3) EDIT it to make sure it does what it needs to do (the result is your _final text_)
- Read once for sense and structure
- Read once to make sure it sounds good
- Read once for grammar
