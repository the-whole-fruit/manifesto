# How to Adopt

## Step 1. Add a The Whole Fruit Manifesto & Guidelines to your `CONTRIBUTING.md`

> One small block of text to add to your CONTRIBUTING.md file, one giant leap in software quality for your project.

Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab use this file to show developers a few guidelines before they submit a PR. We think it's a perfect place to also talk about the guidelines your community follows when communicating in writing. If you adhere to The Whole Fruit Manifesto feel free to copy or link directly to its Writing Guideline. If you don’t have any idea how to structure your `CONTRIBUTING.md` file [here is a template](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) that we think is a good start.


## Step 2. Include a shield in your project

Shields (aka badges) usually let people know about your project status, standards and permissions. So it's a perfect way to communicate that your project abides by The Whole Fruit Manifesto. You can easily add our shield to your `README.md`: 

[![We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. It’s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words.](https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen)](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto)

```js
// use this at the top of your README.md file

[![We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. It’s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words.](https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen)](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto)

// or this

<a href="https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen" title="We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. It’s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words."></a>
```

Alternatively, you can use [shields.io](https://shields.io) to create a shield that's a better fit for your project. Make sure you point it to `https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto`

## Step 3. Sign the manifesto

If you're the owner of an open-source project or organisation, you can [add your name to our `SIGNATORIES.md` file](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/join/signatories.md). This will:
- help you _publicly_ commit to follow The Whole Fruit Manifesto standard in your software projects;
- help other people understand the importance of our cause: _better writing makes for better software_;

<a href="https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/join/signatories.md"><img alt="Sign the Manifesto" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sign%20the%20Manifesto-brightgreen"></a>

## Step 4. Spread the word, save a project

We bet you know a private or open source project that makes you cry everytime you read something they wrote. We all do! And now you can do something about it. Suggest that they check out The Whole Fruit Manifesto. It will do a lot of good to them, to you and to the world wide web.

And, of course, don't forget to give us a star on GitHub and share.
