We hereby declare that we recognize the importance of  effective communication, and commit to doing better. We pledge to improve the way we write _inside_ and _around_ our projects. As part of this process, we will:
- follow [The Whole Fruit Guidelines](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/goodies/guidelines.md) as much as possible;
- copy-paste or link to the [The Whole Fruit Manifesto](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto), to motivate and teach our contributors to write better;
- use the provided [markdown templates](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/tree/master/goodies/templates) (as-is or modified) to ensure our contributors communicate better too;
- admit that you're never _done_ learning how to communicate, and be open to improvements;
- help promote the manifesto with [a link](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto), [a shield](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto/blob/master/.github/contributing.md#include-a-shield-in-your-project), a star on Github or all of them;
